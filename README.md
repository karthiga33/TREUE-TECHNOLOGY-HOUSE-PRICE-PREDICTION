IMPORTING LIBRARIES:

        Importing the libraries are numpy, pandas, matplotlib
        Linear regression, decision tree, Reandom forest, Lasso SVR classifications

UPLOADING THE CSV FILE:

         Uploading the csv file using pandas library And read the csv file

         plot the seaborn plot of price colunm using histogram plot

         To check the shape, info and describe of the given datasets

         Ploting the seaborn plot for price colunm using displot and heatmap

PERFORMING THE EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS:

         Removing the null values using isnull.sum()

         To find Mean, Median, mode of the given datasets
         and plot the histogram plot

ENCODE THE DATASET:

         to Encode the given dataset using Label encoder

SPLIT THE DATAS:

         To split the train and test Datas using Train and test splitting

MODEL FITTING:
